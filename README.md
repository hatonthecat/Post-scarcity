# Post-scarcity
An analysis of a topic I initially embraced more than 10 years ago, but has now taken Silicon Valley by storm.

The question is, what type of abundance are we talking about?

See my [blog post](https://github.com/hatonthecat/Biology/blob/main/I%20wrote%20to%20Freeman%20Dyson%2015%20years%20ago%3B%20he%20responded%20nicely.pdf) on a letter I wrote to Freeman Dyson in 2008.

When I think of abundance, I think of [3D Printed houses](https://builtin.com/3d-printing/3d-printed-house)- leveraging automation to lower the cost of construction, because, you know, the median salary of many U.S. workers is far less than the ability to pay off a 30 year mortgage.

In a post-scarcity world, there would be more houses than people. And labor could be simply fixing up/renovating other people's houses, not flipping them or charging exhorbitant rent. Taxes could still be higher in high-demand cities, but shipping containers as portable condos in multi-story homes like a Carvana freight elevator would be a great way to minimize the cost of moving, while getting to keep all of one's junk (nor have to deal with cleanup). If opportunities are not available in a high-tax city, one can move to a low-tax region, but if the opportunity arises, can move again to an area where there is an job- not all types of employment are long-term despite it being an ideal, even for myself (although it really depends on the type of work). When I think of abundance, I also think of Eric Hunting's [essay](https://www.sciphijournal.org/index.php/2021/09/30/on-solarpunk/) on [Solar Punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk). I don't think of AI datacenters using up 90% of the potable water in Ireland in some not-so-distance future.

In the late 00's, I was infatuated with Tumbleweed Tiny Homes. Initially costing between 39,000 and 49,000, I thought they were an affordable home that many could eventually own, and reduce the homeless population. Yet, the cost of things in the world, whether or not the U.S. can adjust its zoning laws  that prohibit such free standing RVs in most areas, will lead to what has been described as "systemic homelessness."

"What do you find most salient at the moment?

What is at the center of my attention are land and water sovereignty struggles, such as those over the Dakota Access pipeline, over coal mining on the Black Mesa plateau, over extractionism everywhere. My attention is centered on the extermination and extinction crises happening at a worldwide level, on human and non-human displacement and homelessness. That’s where my energies are. My feminism is in these other places and corridors.

What kind of political tactics do you see as being most important – for young climate activists, the Green New Deal, etc?

The degree to which people in these occupations play is a crucial part of how they generate a new political imagination, which in turn points to the kind of work that needs to be done. They open up the imagination of something that is not what [the ethnographer] Deborah Bird Rose calls “double death” – extermination, extraction, genocide.

Now, we are facing a world with all three of those things. We are facing the production of systemic homelessness. The way that flowers aren’t blooming at the right time, and so insects can’t feed their babies and can’t travel because the timing is all screwed up, is a kind of forced homelessness. It’s a kind of forced migration, in time and space.

This is also happening in the human world in spades. In regions like the Middle East and Central America, we are seeing forced displacement, some of which is climate migration. The drought in the Northern Triangle countries of Central America [Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador] is driving people off their land.

So it’s not a humanist question. It’s a multi-kind and multi-species question.'

With AI potentially replacing many people's jobs before any amount of social safety nets can be implemented, our world of climate destruction is leading to more instability and uncertainty. Thus futurists and e/acc that place all their optimism in AI are not believably doing anything to address the cost of living crisis. Hardtech is more than AI, and the manufacture of durable, environmentally conscious goods that resemble more permaculture than disposable planned obsolescence is the only path to true and value-based abundance. In fact, anything that isn't "value based" is explicitly unsustainable as abundance of human goods requires an abundance of vacant landfills.
